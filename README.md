This repository contains a Python notebook for image processing, analysis, and machine learning model training, with applications in medical imaging and computer vision. The workflow includes data loading, visualization, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

## Key Features
- **Image Processing**: Resizing, normalization, and annotation handling
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib/Seaborn for exploratory analysis
- **Model Training**: TensorFlow/Keras implementation
- **U-Net Integration**: (Optional) for segmentation tasks

## Data Loading
- Loads images from /content/drive/MyDrive/archive/images
- Processes JSON annotations

## Preprocessing
- Image resizing to (512, 512)
- Normalization (/255)

## Model Architecture
- Custom CNN or U-Net (for segmentation)

## Evaluation
- Classification metrics
- Confusion matrix

## Applications
- Medical image analysis (tumor detection)
- Satellite imagery segmentation
- Efficient video encoding preprocessing

## U-Net Explanation

- A specialized neural network for precise image segmentation:
text

[Input] → [Downsample] → [Upsample + Skip Connections] → [Pixel-wise Output]

## Advantages:

- Works with small datasets
- Pixel-level accuracy
- Used in medical imaging, autonomous vehicles
